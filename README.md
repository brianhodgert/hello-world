# hello-world
This is my first github repository

The existential question is...am I too old for this shit?
Of course, why try and answer such a question?  Can anything good come from answering this?

I have an opportunity to leverage my wisdom to new and exciting opportunities.  It would be foolish *not* to explore.

Into the breach...
